    "# Hate Speech Detection with Sentinel: Building and Evaluating a Robust Detection Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use the Sentinel library to build a robust hate speech detection model with minimal examples and evaluate it across different content sources. Sentinel excels at detecting extremely rare classes of harmful content using contrastive learning principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Data:\n",
    "- **Positive Examples (~1,500)**: Extracted from the Southern Poverty Law Center's (SPLC) Extremist Files database, specifically from \"In Their Own Words\" sections that contain direct quotes from individuals or groups identified as extremists. These quotes represent authentic examples of hate speech from various extremist ideologies.\n",
    "- **Negative Examples (~15,000)**: Obtained from the Lex Fridman podcast dataset, which contains neutral, intellectual discussions. The 10:1 ratio of negative-to-positive examples reflects the typical imbalance in real-world content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Data:\n",
    "- **Test Positives**: Podcast transcripts, known for controversial and potentially harmful content.\n",
    "- **Test Negatives**: Different episodes from Lex Fridman's podcast, providing a contrast to potentially harmful content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Extract extremist quotes from SPLC and neutral content from conversational datasets. Segment longer texts into manageable chunks of 512 tokens with 128-token stride.\n",
    "2. **Model Building**: Create embeddings of both positive and negative examples using the MiniLM-L6-v2 model, then build a Sentinel index to measure semantic similarity to the hate speech class.\n",
    "3. **Evaluation**: Score content at both segment and episode levels using contrastive learning and statistical measures like skewness to identify patterns across observations.\n",
    "4. **Analysis**: Compare the distribution of hate speech affinity scores between a controversial podcast and Lex Fridman content to validate the model's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates how Sentinel can detect rare patterns of concerning content with limited training examples, focusing on the semantic similarity to known extremist language rather than requiring extensive labeled datasets."

He frequently demonizes LGBTQ+ people and promotes racist and anti-transgender conspiracy theories. Walsh leads a campaign against gender-affirming health care that has targeted American hospitals with harassment and has advocated executing doctors who provide health care to transgender people. Walsh is also known for perpetuating the notion of anti-white racism, which is grounded in white supremacy, and spreading conspiracy theories about supposed campaigns of anti-white violence.', 'Walsh is a self-described “', 'theocratic fascist', '” who is one of the most prominent anti-transgender voices in American right-wing media. Walsh sometimes suggests his most extreme comments are satirical or in jest, as when he explained why he describes himself as a theocratic fascist. However, his comments regularly reflect male and white supremacy and transphobia and are often used by radical right-wing extremists against marginalized communities. Walsh hosts “The Matt Walsh Show” on the Daily Wire and has written several books that promote anti-transgender pseudoscience and conspiracy theories. Walsh has advocated political violence and violence against transgender people and medical providers that give gender-affirming care. Some of these facilities have received bomb threats and have faced the suspension of care and increased security measures.']\n",

    "## Conclusion and Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've built and evaluated a hate speech detection system using Sentinel with minimal training data. The key aspects of our approach include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficient Model Creation**: We constructed a hate speech detection model using only ~1,500 extremist quotes from SPLC as positive examples, balanced against ~15,000 neutral Lex Fridman podcast segments. This demonstrates Sentinel's ability to work effectively with limited training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-Dataset Evaluation**: By testing on a controversial podcast content (not seen during training) and comparing against Lex Fridman episodes, we validated the model's generalization capabilities and resistance to domain-specific biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-level Analysis**: We analyzed content at both segment level (individual text chunks) and episode level (aggregated scores using skewness), showing how patterns of concerning language emerge even when individual segments might not cross thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistical Validation**: The distributions and percentile analysis demonstrate clear differentiation between the two content sources, with the other podcast showing significantly higher percentages of high-risk segments compared to Lex Fridman's podcast.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Practical Application**: The CSV exports and visualization tools enable further analysis and potential integration into content moderation workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This methodology showcases Sentinel's capability to detect rare class patterns in text with minimal examples, highlighting its potential for practical applications in online safety, content moderation, and harmful content detection across diverse platforms."

    "Our analysis reveals an important pattern in how harmful content manifests across different sources, demonstrating Sentinel's ability to detect what we might call the \"wolf in sheep's clothes\" phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Distribution Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the segment-level histograms and statistics, we observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Low Central Tendency in Both Sources**: Both Lex Fridman podcasts and the other podcast have segment score distributions with relatively low central tendency (mean/median) - the majority of content segments from both sources receive low hate speech scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critical Difference in Distribution Shape**: While both distributions have similar centers, the other podcast' distribution is notably **right-skewed with a heavy tail** - showing a relatively small number of highly toxic segments that score much higher than the average content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The \"Hidden Toxicity\" Problem**: This pattern represents a common challenge in content moderation - harmful content often appears as occasional \"spikes\" within otherwise benign material. Simple averaging methods would dilute these spikes, potentially missing concerning content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Sentinel's Episode-Level Scoring Captures This Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentinel's methodology effectively addresses this challenge through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Sensitivity to Skewness**: Rather than simple averaging, the episode-level scores account for distribution shape, giving higher weight to right-skewed distributions where even a few high-scoring segments exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Capturing Rare but Significant Signals**: This approach successfully identifies content sources that occasionally \"show their teeth\" with harmful rhetoric, even when such rhetoric represents a small percentage of the total content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Moderation Value**: The resulting episode-level scores place the other podcast episodes significantly higher than Lex Fridman episodes, creating a clear prioritization signal for content moderation efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates why robust hate speech detection requires attention not just to average content characteristics, but to distribution patterns that might reveal occasional but significant harmful content within otherwise unremarkable material."
